# LC4 Reverse Assembler

## Overview

This project entails the development of a disassembler for reverse assembling PennSim-generated .OBJ files, translating hex instructions into LC4 assembly code based on the LC4 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). The disassembler is designed to handle the complexities of memory allocation, label association, content storage, assembly representation, and node traversal within a linked list structure.

## Features

1. **File Format Support:**
   - The disassembler is capable of reverse assembling .OBJ files generated by PennSim, a simulator for the LC4 architecture.

2. **Hex to Assembly Translation:**
   - Converts hex instructions into human-readable LC4 assembly code, adhering to the LC4 ISA.

3. **Linked List Architecture:**
   - Implements a linked list structure for LC4's program and data memories, facilitating organized representation and traversal.

4. **ISA Support:**
   - Accommodates 29 distinct LC4 ISA instructions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the architecture.

5. **Memory Management:**
   - Efficiently manages memory allocation within the constraints of the LC4 architecture, optimizing resource usage.

6. **Label Association:**
   - Associates labels with specific memory locations, supporting program flow and branching in assembly code.
